# To do list project plan

## Idea
The idea for this to do list will be as following:
- Users will start with a board with 3 columns: To do, Doing, Done (these will be static columns that cannot be edited or deleted)
- Users can add tasks
- Tasks will contain a title, description, due date, and a priority
- When the due date is reached, the task will get a different color and the users will be notified
- The design will be simple and easy to use
- The board & tasks will run on a single page, so when a task is clicked, a modal will pop up with the task details
- Vue integration?
- Users will be able to create an account and log in
- Goal of the project is to show of my laravel skills and to learn more about Vue
